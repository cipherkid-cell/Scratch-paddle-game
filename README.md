Paddle & Ball Game – CS50 Week 0 (Scratch Project)

This is a classic paddle-and-ball game built using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) for CS50x – Week 0. The player controls a paddle using only mouse movement along the X-axis.

How to Play?

- Keep the ball bouncing — don’t let it fall!
- If the ball touches the bottom red line, the game resets.

Features
- Mouse-based paddle control (X-axis only)
- Ball bounces with logic and increasing challenge
- Score tracker and background change
